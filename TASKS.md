# Working Notes

## Commit cadence
- Morning session ~9 AM: 2 commits
- Evening session ~7 PM: 3 commits
- Times will drift around other routines; this is a target, not a hard rule.
- Working directly on `main` only for small/safe changes. Anything that touches
  auth, ticket inventory, or the DB schema goes through a feature branch + PR,
  reviewed before it merges.

## Scope roadmap (in order)
1. **Tests** — no coverage exists yet. Start with auth (register/login),
   event CRUD, and the order/ticket purchase flow, since that's the one with
   concurrency risk (overselling tickets).
2. **Missing backend features** — refunds/cancellations, event search &
   filtering, admin endpoints, email notification on purchase.
3. **Deployment/DevOps** — Dockerize the app, add GitHub Actions CI (build +
   run the test suite from step 1), deploy somewhere reachable.
4. **Frontend** — optional/last. A thin client to demo the API end-to-end.
   Lower priority than hardening the backend itself.

Rationale: features 2-4 all build on code that currently has zero test
coverage, including the transactional logic that prevents overselling
tickets. Locking down tests first means later changes have something to
break against instead of failing silently in production.

## Current state (as of 2026-08-26)
- Auth: register/login with JWT, roles ATTENDEE/ORGANIZER/ADMIN.
- Events: organizer CRUD, public browse of published events.
- Orders/Tickets: purchase flow with transactional inventory checks.
- Tests: unit coverage for JwtTokenProvider, JwtAuthenticationFilter,
  AuthService, EventService, OrderService (19 tests, merged in PR #1).
- GraphQL: a query layer over the events read path (events/event(id)),
  merged in PR #2.
- No CI, no frontend, no deployment yet.
- 2026-08-28: repo moved from a fork of yashaswini-tdr/event_management-platform
  into praneethnaidu1910-cmd's own account, so the automated sessions have
  admin-level push access (the prior setup hit a 403 - the Claude GitHub App
  wasn't authorized on someone else's repo). Two automated runs that day
  (GlobalExceptionHandler tests, and an event search endpoint) got stuck in
  ephemeral sandboxes and never reached GitHub before this move - that work
  is lost and needs to be redone, not just resumed.

## Automated sessions (9 AM / 7 PM daily)
Unattended cloud sessions work on a shared branch per day: `daily/YYYY-MM-DD`,
created off `main` by the morning run, continued by the evening run. They
push that branch to origin but never touch `main` and never open a PR -
praneethnaidu1910-cmd reviews the diff and opens the PR by hand.

Each run appends an entry below before pushing, so the next run (and the
human reviewing later) knows what happened and what's next. Newest first.
